(Also check TODOs in comments)

Filter for class flags/exclude certain class flags

Message to suggest locking the class if a constraint violation is intentional

success message on save should be larger

Scorer which tries to avoid wasting resources?

Probably bold special scheduling needs more, and include the text if it exists

Some kind of saving bug, complained about room being occupied

Adjust estimates for the timeout

Instructions on turning off scorer weights

Better per-section docs

Bugs:

Page shouldn't just crash if tags are malformatted.

AJAX scheduler should only link to the Autoscheduler Frontend if said module
exists.

update_move_section and update_swap_section are not always the same as
unschedule then schedule consecutively because the section will not actually be
unscheduled at the time that update_schedule is called. This leads to
idempotence issues.

New features:
Return multiple results?

AJAX change log entries can include users

Add the license/LU header to all files

Implement ResourceMovementScorer

Robustness:

Tests and checks:
db tests should load resource criteria, constraints, scorers?
db test for save raising if there's a conflict or if someone moved the class
(??)
model tests for model functions
tests for resource checker
test manipulator, constraints, scoring???

need unittests for schedule operations and saving somehow
unittest for already-scheduled multihour class

scoring student-class-hours should account for classroom capacity

test to be able to handle sections which don't satsify constraints
