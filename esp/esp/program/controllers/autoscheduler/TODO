Double-check that locked classes are ignored?

Bugs:

save() should check whether sections are locked before saving
save() might have an issue if a teacher is teaching a non-recognized class and
it gets moved?
save() can have an issue if someone moves a class after you saved but before
you committed
 - The fix assumes that saving is what takes the most time, and checking is
   cheap. This is probably not a bad assumption but might want to be checked.
search might try to unschedule sections multiple times
pass section scheduling infos in histories in order to detect external changes (frontend)

New features:
Implement a timeout on search
Implement a faster search
Return multiple results?

AJAX change log entries can include users

Add the license/LU header to all files

Implement ResourceMovementScorer

Clean up frontend display (e.g. hide stuff, split sections)
Frontend should warn that you haven't saved yet

Robustness:

save() might want to check to make sure that the lists of teachers teaching each
section don't change either

saving is probably really slow
saving errors should be more informative

be able to deal with schedules with multi-scheduled rooms

Tests and checks:
db tests should load lunch blocks, resource criteria, constraints, and
locked sections
more tests for loading teacher availabilities with classes already scheduled
db tests should test for when classes are already scheduled (or otherwise
excluded classes), also saving
db test for partial save rollback
model tests for model functions
tests for resource checker

need unittests for schedule operations and saving somehow
unittest for already-scheduled multihour class

scoring student-class-hours should account for classroom capacity

test to be able to handle sections which don't satsify constraints
