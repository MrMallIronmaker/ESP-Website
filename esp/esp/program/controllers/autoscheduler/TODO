Think about what classrooms not to use
Logic about resources being required or optional

Logic relating to locked classes

Potentially make a distinction between a required and optional constraint
(required constraint is also reflected in the search logic)
Or, constraints can have a search pruning functionality.

sanity checks:
timeblocks shouldn't overlap
classrooms shouldn't have duplicate timeblocks in availability
more assumption checks
