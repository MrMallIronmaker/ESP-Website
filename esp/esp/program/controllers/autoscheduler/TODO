(Also check TODOs in comments)

Bugs:

constraints (and anywhere else) which tries to use timedelta.seconds won't work
across multiple days

save() should check whether sections are locked before saving

New features:
Implement a way to define ResourceCriteria
Implement resource constraints and resource scoring

Cache common functions like AS_Classroom.get_roomslots_by_duration and/or speed
them up (if cache, be very careful about making availability changes)

Be able to specify a regex for importing classrooms (resource criterion?
Possibly also make resource criteria be able to specify whether they only apply
to newly scheduled rooms)

Implement search, possibly with constraints having a pruning mechanism

save() should send updates to the AJAX scheduler, and this should be tested
carefully (as well as making sure partial changes don't get committed, and that
arbitrary AJAX updates don't fuck us over)

Robustness:

Handle sections/rooms having multiple resources/resource requests of the same
name but different values

Handle two classrooms having the same name

complain if timeslots are too short (maybe compare to DELTA_TIME in constants)

save() might want to check to make sure that the lists of teachers teaching each
section don't change either

saving is probably really slow
saving errors should be more informative
save() should have some way to do partial saves so you don't lose a ton of work

be able to deal with schedules with multi-scheduled rooms

Tests and checks:
db tests should load lunch blocks, resource criteria, constraints, and
locked sections
more tests for loading teacher availabilities with classes already scheduled
db tests should test for when classes are already scheduled (or otherwise
excluded classes), also saving
model tests for model functions
tests for resource checker

need unittests for schedule operations and saving somehow
unittest for already-scheduled multihour class

scoring student-class-hours should account for classroom capacity

test to be able to handle sections which don't satsify constraints
