(Also check TODOs in comments)

Filter for class flags/exclude certain class flags

Scorer which tries to avoid wasting resources?

Probably bold special scheduling needs more, and include the text if it exists

Adjust estimates for the timeout

Instructions on turning off scorer weights

Better per-section docs

Bugs:

Page shouldn't just crash if tags are malformatted.

AJAX scheduler should only link to the Autoscheduler Frontend if said module
exists.

There's an unknown bug which sometimes causes saving (in particular, swaps) to
fail because "the room is already occupied" (i.e. check_can_schedule_sections
complains). However this doesn't happen all the time and I was unable to
intentionally reproduce it.

New features:
Return multiple results?

AJAX change log entries can include users

Add the license/LU header to all files

Implement ResourceMovementScorer

Robustness:

Tests and checks:
db tests should load resource criteria, constraints, scorers?
db test for save raising if there's a conflict or if someone moved the class
(??)
model tests for model functions
tests for resource checker
test manipulator, constraints, scoring???

need unittests for schedule operations and saving somehow
unittest for already-scheduled multihour class

scoring student-class-hours should account for classroom capacity

test to be able to handle sections which don't satsify constraints
