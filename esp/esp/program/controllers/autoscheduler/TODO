(Also check TODOs in comments)

Bugs:

save() should check whether sections are locked before saving
save() can have an issue if someone moves a class after you saved but before
you committed
pass section scheduling infos in histories

New features:
Implement a timeout on search
Implement a faster search

AJAX change log entries can include users

Implement a frontend

Add the license/LU header to all files

Implement ResourceMovementScorer

Robustness:

save() might want to check to make sure that the lists of teachers teaching each
section don't change either

saving is probably really slow
saving errors should be more informative
save() should have some way to do partial saves so you don't lose a ton of work

be able to deal with schedules with multi-scheduled rooms

Tests and checks:
db tests should load lunch blocks, resource criteria, constraints, and
locked sections
more tests for loading teacher availabilities with classes already scheduled
db tests should test for when classes are already scheduled (or otherwise
excluded classes), also saving
model tests for model functions
tests for resource checker

need unittests for schedule operations and saving somehow
unittest for already-scheduled multihour class

scoring student-class-hours should account for classroom capacity

test to be able to handle sections which don't satsify constraints
