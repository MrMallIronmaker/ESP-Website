Better per-section docs

Bugs:

Page shouldn't just crash if tags are malformatted.

There's an unknown bug which sometimes causes saving (in particular, swaps) to
fail because "the room is already occupied" (i.e. check_can_schedule_sections
complains). However this doesn't happen all the time and I was unable to
intentionally reproduce it.

New features:
Return multiple results?

Probably bold special scheduling needs more, and include the text if it exists

Filter for class flags/exclude certain class flags

Implement ResourceMovementScorer

Add a scorer which tries to avoid wasting resources (should be separate from
existing scorers though)

Tests and checks:
db tests should load resource criteria, constraints, scorers?
db test for save raising if there's a conflict or if someone moved the class
(??)
model tests for model functions
tests for resource checker
test manipulator, constraints, scoring???

need unittests for schedule operations and saving somehow
unittest for already-scheduled multihour class

scoring student-class-hours should account for classroom capacity

test to be able to handle sections which don't satsify constraints
