(Also check TODOs in comments)

Bugs:

What if a teacher is teaching two classes at once, and we know about one of
them?

constraints (and anywhere else) which tries to use timedelta.seconds won't work
across multiple days

New features:
Implement a way to define ResourceCriteria
Implement resource constraints

Cache common functions like AS_Classroom.get_roomslots_by_duration

Be able to specify a regex for importing classrooms

Consistency checks should have better reporting where they failed as well

Implement scoring
Implement search, possibly with constraints having a pruning mechanism

save() should send updates to the AJAX scheduler, and this should be tested
carefully (as well as making sure partial changes don't get committed)

Robustness:

Handle sections/rooms having multiple resources/resource requests of the same
name but different values

Handle two classrooms having the same name

complain if timeslots are too short (maybe compare to DELTA_TIME in constants)

save() might want to check to make sure that the lists of teachers teaching each
section don't change either

saving is probably really slow
saving errors should be more informative
save() should have some way to do partial saves so you don't lose a ton of work

be able to deal with schedules with multi-scheduled rooms

Tests and checks:
model tests should load lunch blocks, resource criteria, constraints, and
locked sections
more tests for loading teacher availabilities with classes already scheduled
model tests should test for when classes are already scheduled (or otherwise
excluded classes), also saving
tests for resource checker
lunch needs consistency checks, including that the timeslots are sorted
teacher availability dict needs consistency checks
section availability dict needs consistency checks
teacher sections teaching needs consistency checks
consistency checks for teacher dict, class section dict, classroom dict,
resources dicts
consistency check that timeslots not span multiple days
consistency check for timeslot duration

need unittests for schedule operations and saving somehow
unittest for already-scheduled multihour class

scoring student-class-hours should account for classroom capacity

test to be able to handle sections which don't satsify constraints
